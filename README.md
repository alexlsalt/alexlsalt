### Hey, hi, hello! I'm Alex ðŸ‘‹

---

I'm a self-taught software engineer with a background in customer support, freelance web design, and teaching English in a French high school. At the end of 2019, I left a truly wonderful job in customer support within a 100% remote and distributed startup to teach myself how to code on a full-time basis after first dabbling with HTML and CSS in my free time. At the beginning of 2020, I found myself at my laptop with a blank slate of GitHub commits that I wanted to start filling in as soon as I could.

Over the course of this year, I've done quite a lot including teaching myself JavaScript and React, building several fun and interesting projects while using the skills I was simultaneously learning (a wonderful and exciting experience to say the least!), submitting my first hackathon project, giving my first talk at a tech-conference (CodeLand:Distributed), and even launching a podcast for other creative women who code!

I'm definitely a major self-starter, and I'm at my best when I have a handful of interesting projects to work on. As a web developer, I've always considered myself to be at the intersection of creativity and logic - viewing the code I write as a truly worthy vehicle of pursuing my creative impulses and indulging my undying sense of curiosity and love of learning.

**My current tech stack**: _Ruby, Ruby on Rails, JavaScript ES6, React/Hooks, Firebase Firestore, Firebase Authentication, HTML/CSS, TailwindCSS, Git_

- âš¡ Iâ€™m currently working on deepening my web development skills, specifically with building in-depth side projects using React. At the moment, I'm developing a website I'd built a few years ago on Squarespace as a resource for other English teachers in France as a React web app. Feel free to take a look at the repo [here.](https://github.com/alexlsalt/soyouthinkyoucanfrance)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to implement React Router for a static blog I have on my project (above). I feel like I'm *this* close to that moment where everything clicks, and I'm really excited about it! In the near future, I'd really like to start learning Python and exploring that.
