### Hey! I'm Alex ðŸ‘‹

---

I'm a software engineer at Orbit. At the end of 2019, I left a truly wonderful job in customer support within a 100% remote and distributed startup to teach myself how to code on a full-time basis after first dabbling with HTML and CSS in my free time. At the beginning of 2020, I found myself at my laptop with a blank slate of GitHub commits that I wanted to start filling in as soon as I could.

I'm definitely a major self-starter, and I'm at my best when I have a handful of interesting projects to work on. As a web developer, I've always considered myself to be at the intersection of creativity and logic - viewing the code I write as a truly worthy vehicle of pursuing my creative impulses and indulging my undying sense of curiosity and love of learning.

**My current tech stack**: _Ruby, Ruby on Rails, JavaScript ES6, React/Hooks, Firebase Firestore, Firebase Authentication, HTML/CSS, TailwindCSS, Git_
